**Project Title: Fake News Detection**

**Overview:**

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either fake or real based on their content. With the rise of misinformation, fake news detection has become critical in helping users identify reliable information sources.

**Dataset:**

The dataset contains columns such as:
* title: The title of the news article.
* text: The content of the article.
* label: The target variable, where 0 indicates Fake News and 1 indicates Real News.

**Project Structure:**

Here's a breakdown of the key steps in the notebook:

**1.** **Importing Libraries:**

    -Numpy
    -Pandas
    -re 
    -nltk
    -scikit-learn
    -matplotlib
    
   These are imported for data manipulation, regex operations, natural language processing and modeling of data. 
   
**2. Loading Dataset:**

    -The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv() into a pandas DataFrame for analysis and displayed for a quick overview.
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

    -Various EDA techniques are applied to understand the data structure, distribution, and any underlying patterns.
**4. Data Visualization:**

    -Visualize the distribution of fake vs. real news and examined the dataset's structure.
**5. Data Preprocessing:**

    -Text preprocessing include steps such as removing punctuation, stopwords and performing stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms and to prepare the data for modeling.
**6. Feature Engineering:**

    -Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert text data into numeric features for model input.
**7. Model Training and Evaluation:**

    -Several machine learning algorithms are applied, and their performance is evaluated by checking its score.
**8. Prediction using User-defined program:**

    -News is checked by the input of index number entered by the user itself to see whether it is fake or real news.

**Usage:**

To use the jupyter notebook, run each cell sequentially. Modify the dataset path in the data loading cell if necessary.

**Result:**

The notebook provides a summary of the model's ability to detect which is fake news or real news.The result shows the accuracy score of the model to detect fake news.

**Conclusion:**

This Fake News Detection project demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges associated with misinformation. By using natural language processing and classification techniques, the model can effectively distinguish between real and fake news articles, providing a tool that can be used to help curb the spread of false information.
